# My Discord Usage Stats 

This is a small tool that tracks how many messages you send on Discord â€” by watching your clipboard when you copy them.

## Features

- Tracks your copied messages
- Logs message content + timestamp
- Keeps running quietly in the background
- Saves everything to `data/usage.json`
- No bots, no login, no server IDs

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/my-discord-usage-stats
cd my-discord-usage-stats
pip install -r requirements.txt
